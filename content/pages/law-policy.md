## {{% resource_link aa5524bd-44ac-a6cd-4acb-ef45ca9582d4 "STS.012/STS.008 Science in Action: Technologies and Controversies in Everyday Life" %}}

*Author:* Dwai Banerjee

*Lecture Module:* "Big Data and Personal Privacy"

*Keywords:* privacy; AI; surveillance; data ethics

*Module Goals:*

- To find overlaps and differences in the experience of students learning about their right to privacy
- To discuss whether they believe existing rights to be adequate
- To examine whether current ethical standards (such as those instituted by the GDPR) sufficiently protect their rights (as they exist or as they believe should exist).
